            <h2>What is AI?</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include recognizing patterns, understanding language, solving complex problems, and even making decisions autonomously. AI systems use algorithms to process and analyze vast amounts of data in order to recognize trends and predict outcomes more efficiently than humans. The global AI market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 120% in the next decade, driven by advancements in processing power, data availability, and algorithmic improvements (Howarth, 2024).</p>

            <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
            <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling machines to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. Unlike traditional software, where programmers must define specific rules and logic, ML systems use algorithms that allow them to automatically identify patterns in data and adjust their behavior accordingly. One of the most common types of machine learning is supervised learning, where a model is trained on labeled data and learns to make predictions based on that data. For example, a machine learning model can be trained to recognize objects in images by being fed thousands of labeled pictures (Pattam, 2021).</p>

            <h2>Applications of AI and ML</h2>
            <p>The applications of AI and Machine Learning span across various industries, transforming how businesses operate and how services are delivered to consumers. In healthcare, AI is being used to develop personalized treatment plans, analyze medical images, and even assist in the discovery of new drugs. Autonomous vehicles, powered by AI and ML algorithms, are expected to reduce traffic accidents and increase transportation efficiency in the near future.</p>

            <p>One prominent example of AI in use today is Netflixâ€™s recommendation system. Netflix employs machine learning to analyze users' viewing habits, search patterns, and even the time of day they stream content. By processing this data, the system predicts what users may want to watch next, creating a personalized entertainment experience. Similar machine learning models are used in e-commerce, where AI suggests products based on browsing history, purchases, and other user interactions (Netflix Research, n.d.).</p>

            <h2>Significance in Software Engineering</h2>
            <p>The significance of AI and ML in software engineering cannot be understated. These technologies have led to the creation of more adaptable, responsive, and efficient applications. For instance, in predictive analytics, AI systems can detect patterns in historical data and predict future trends with remarkable accuracy. In software engineering, AI-driven development tools are being used to optimize code, automate testing, and even generate code from natural language descriptions, allowing for more rapid development cycles and higher-quality software (Brown, 2021).</p>
